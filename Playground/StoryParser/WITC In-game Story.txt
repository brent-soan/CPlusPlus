Prologue


Act 1
Week 1
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The convoy came to a stop before the camp. The men spilled out, half-dazed from the ride, greeted not by welcome but by shouting.
2. Chaves Pic:
   1. “Attention! You’re soldiers now, not lost sheep. You all are to address me as Sergeant Chaves, and you’ll be following my orders from now on.”
3. Chaves Pic:
   1. Sergeant Chaves' voice cut through the wind, sharp and unyielding. The air smelled of rust and mud. Somewhere in the distance, the sound of gunfire echoed faintly. The war felt closer than you expected.
4. Chaves Pic:
   1. Sergeant Chaves performed a roll call. One man stammered when called and earned a daunting glare. You kept your eyes forward. Behind you, someone coughed. Another whispered a prayer.
5. Camp Area:
   1. Everyone arrived at the camp. Rows of iron bunks, the stench of damp uniforms, and the lack of any sanitary equipment. 
6. Camp Area:
   1. You dropped your stuff at your assigned area, surrounded by strangers who all wore the same expression: uncertainty masked as silence.
7. Camp Area:
   1. One of them laughed under his breath. Another muttered that the place looked more like a prison than a camp.
8. Camp Area:
   1. You stayed quiet. You didn’t join in. You just watched the smoke curl toward the ceiling until the whistle blew for lights out.
9. Black Screen:
   1. The next day, dawn brought shouting. Everyone gathered to eat their meal.
10. Meal Area:
   1. “Finish up quickly. We will be proceeding with drills in a few minutes.” Sergeant Chaves yelled.
11. Meal Area:
   1. As soon as the whistle blew, everyone made their way to the training grounds.
12. Training Grounds:
   1. Everyone trained on the mud, performing several drills that tired everyone out. Sergeant Chaves' commands cut through the haze.
13. Training Grounds:
   1. Running, crawling, pushups, sit-ups, rifle handling. All happening with little to no breaks in between.
14. Training Grounds:
   1. “You’ll learn to fight tired, because the enemy won’t wait for you to rest!”
15. Training Grounds:
   1. You stumbled once, earning a boot to the heel and a growl of “Keep moving.” By the end of it, your arms shook too much to hold the rifle steady, but you didn’t dare to drop it.
16. Camp Area:
   1. The camp quieted. Occasional murmur from nearby bunks, someone passing around leftover food, another hummed a tune, low and sad.
17. Black Screen:
   1. This vicious cycle of the campgrounds continues over and over again. This is the new reality for everyone here.
18. Camp Area:
   1. One fateful evening, papers were being handed out, and it was announced that everyone was given an opportunity to write to their loved ones. 
19. Camp Area:
   1. You sat in your bunk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. Thinking of home, of your Mom you left behind, of how she will feel knowing the circumstances of your situation.


Week 2
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The days began to blur. The same whistle, the same mud, the same shouts echoing through the camp.
2. Meal Area:
   1. Breakfast came late. Someone joked about the food tasting worse every day. Another recruit replied, “You’ll eat anything when you’re hungry enough.” A few chuckled.
   2. The fragments of laughter that sounded out of place in this world of blood, sweat, and tears.
   3. “Attention! I want everyone outside by the training grounds in 5 minutes. Latecomers have a punishment.” Sergeant Chaves yelled.
3. Black Screen:
   1. No one was late. Sergeant Chaves stood by with his arms crossed as everyone did their drills.
4. Chaves Pic:
   1. “You’re not here to enjoy the breeze!” he barked.
   2. The dirt kicked up by boots turned to dust in the air, coating every breath.
   3. One recruit stumbled and nearly collapsed. Chaves yelled for two others to drag him up.
   4. “If one man falls, all of you fall!”
   5. Your body ached, but the drills didn’t stop. You forced yourself to keep moving, jaw clenched, lungs on fire.
5. Camp Area:
   1. That night, the barracks were quieter than usual. The harsh training that day put a toll on everyone.
   2. But you overhear the chatters of someone speaking of their background. A few men traded short words about home. Their distant towns, families, and half-remembered meals.
6. Black Screen:
   1. Hearing those words makes you wonder the same. You think about these thoughts as you fall to sleep.
   2. The next morning brought new orders. It’s time for live-fire exercises.
7. Training Grounds:
   1. Rifles cracked through the fields. The smell of gunpowder filled the air.
   2. Chaves shouted commands between bursts of noise.
   3. One man’s rifle jammed, another flinched too early. Everyone wavered, but no one stopped.
   4. The chaos of men shooting rifles. This was the first time you ever shot a gun, and it may be the same for many.
   5. Sergeant Chaves inspected the field, silent for once, only nodding slightly before ordering everyone to clean their rifles.
8. Black Screen:
   1. Another set of exhausting days of training has passed. You lose count of how long it’s been. 
   2. Yet another quiet night and everyone was given a new piece of paper. Another opportunity to write again.


Week 3
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The days pressed on, each one carving away a little more of who you were before you left home.
   2. Routine had turned into instinct. You woke before the whistle now.
2. Training Grounds:
   1. “Move, move, move!” Sergeant Chaves’ voice carried across the perimeter.
   2. You ducked, crawled, and rolled through the mud, feeling the weight of your rifle press into your chest.
   3. The men no longer groaned out loud, instead they just endured.
   4. During a drill, you tripped and fell. But someone beside you offered you their hand.
   5. “Careful, man. The Sergeant is watching.”
   6. You nodded your thanks and he grinned faintly before continuing.
3. Black Screen:
   1. “That’s enough for now. Enjoy your meal.”
4. Meal Area:
   1. You got your portions, started chowing down your food.
   2. A familiar figure approaches you.
   3. It was the person that lent you a hand earlier during training.
   4. “Hey, mind if I stay here?”
   5. The two of you ate together.
   6. “The name’s Ramos. Not that it matters, but it’s nice to see a friendly face out here.”
   7. You both chatted about how rough it has been and how much you both miss your homes.
   8. “Once we are out of this mess, let’s get a few drinks together. How about it?”
   9. The optimism and kindness Ramos has filled you with joy as you find yourself making a friend amidst the war.
5. Black Screen:
   1. “Attention!”
   2. And before you know it, it’s back to training.
6. Camp Area:
   1. Night fell over the camp, the air was thick with the smell of sweat. Sergeant Chaves let everyone rest earlier than usual.
   2. Ramos visited you and you both chatted.
   3. “Quiet down, I’m trying to catch some sleep.”
   4. “Sorry about that.” Ramos said calmingly.
7. Black Screen:
   1. And soon enough, everyone went to sleep.
   2. The next following days feel like a drag. Despite the struggles, you cling on to hope.


Week 4
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. These routines feel more natural to you.
   2. The mud, the noise, the orders. They all blurred into something almost bearable.
   3. You moved with the others now, not as strangers, but as one body that knew when to stand, march, or breathe.
2. Chaves Pic:
   1. “Formations!” Sergeant Chaves barked.
   2. No one flinched this time. The line straightened, movements in sync.
   3. “Not bad,” he muttered. “Maybe soon you all will be real soldiers.”
   4. It wasn’t the praise everyone had hoped for, but it felt close enough.
3. Training Grounds:
   1. During training, Ramos approached beside you.
   2. His steps were steady, breath calm.
   3. “You’re getting faster,” he said.
   4. You glanced at him and joked about him getting slower.
4. Black Screen:
   1. He grinned.
   2. Soon enough, a break was called.
5. Meal Area:
   1. You and Ramos sat beside each other.
   2. “The same old, same old huh?” Ramos said.
   3. Not like you enjoyed the food here, nor did you hate it.
   4. You were just glad that there was food.
   5. “Heh, it looks like they are starting to save costs,” you overheard. It’s true but there’s nothing you can do.
   6. Someone walked by you two.
   7. “Hey, if it isn’t the chatterboxes.” He said.
   8. “Sorry about that again. We will try to be more quiet next time.” Ramos replied.
   9. He joins you both, uninvited, yet something about it felt welcoming.
   10. “Food’s getting rough. Bet the Sergeant eats better than this.”
   11. You glanced at him. But you don’t seem to disagree.
   12. “The name’s Diaz, wish I could just ditch this place.”
   13. “You can say that again.” Ramos said jokingly. But Diaz had a more serious look.
   14. “You know, if I get the opportunity I would.” Diaz replied.
   15. You think to yourself that duty and responsibility are more important, but deep down you too want the same.
   16. As you continued your meals, the three of you chatted for a while.
6. Black Screen:
   1. Later that day, Sergeant Chaves made the men dig trenches for discipline.
   2. Ramos tagged alongside you, and before you knew it, Diaz had already become a member in your circle.
7. Camp Area:
   1. As the sun dipped low, a rare breeze swept through the camp. Someone had been using the paper given to him to create a makeshift set of playing cards.
   2. It wasn’t the best, a source of entertainment was relieving.
   3. The game didn’t have clear rules, but it didn’t matter.
   4. The laughter that followed was real, even for only a while.
   5. Diaz lost every round, accusing everyone for cheating.
   6. “Ugh, even god is never on my side,” he groaned.
   7. “Maybe god is testing you,” Ramos said.
   8. “Then this god blatantly hates me.”
   9. Everyone laughed.
   10. Even Sergeant Chaves who was patrolling the area, watching at a distance.
   11. He didn’t shout for silence, and for a moment, you caught a glimpse of his smile.
8. Black Screen:
   1. When lights-out came, the chatter lingered longer than usual. 
   2. The camp felt different. Not softer, but less lonely.
   3. “You ever wonder what’ll be like once it ends?” Ramos said softly.
   4. “If it does end.” Diaz muttered.
   5. You didn’t say anything, but you know for sure that you don’t want to be facing what comes next alone.


Week 5
Slides (in order):
1. Chaves Pic:
   1. “Live rounds today,” Sergeant Chaves announced, voice low but firm. “You miss the target, you don’t eat.”
   2. He wasn’t joking.
2. Shooting Pic:
   1. You raised your rifle, hands steady. The first shot cracked through the air, sharp and deafening. But the recoil bit your shoulder. 
   2. Next to you, Ramos fired clean and calm. Diaz flinched, cursed under his breath, and tried again.
   3. “You got this Diaz. You’ll learn,” Ramos said.
   4. “Yeah, if I don’t shoot my foot first,” Diaz muttered.
   5. The shooting continued for a short while before the Sergeant announced a change of instructions.
   6. “Think of these not as targets anymore, but as enemies. Members of the Legion.”
   7. An act so simple, yet you start to falter.
   8. “You hesitate,” Chaves growled, “you die.”
   9. “These people are monsters. They will do anything to get what they desire.”
   10. “Even if it means the lives of others.”
   11. But in the mind of these men, they have never taken the life of anyone before.
   12. When the smoke cleared, Chaves walked the line, inspecting each shot.
   13. He stopped in front of you, looked at your target, then nodded, almost approvingly.
   14. You surprised even yourself for that.
3. Camp Area:
   1. Later that day, the men cleaned their rifles in silence. The smell of oil, sweat, and metal filled the air.
   2. Diaz broke it first. “So… when do we stop pretending this is training?”
   3. “When the bullets start firing back.” Ramos said.
   4. “Wowie, can’t wait,” Diaz replied.
   5. You said nothing and stared at your rifle.
4. Meal Area:
   1. That evening, the meal was unusually quiet. Chaves stood near the entrance, arms crossed.
   2. The atmosphere felt heavier as the growing fear of conflict continued to haunt the minds of everyone.
   3. “Orders will be here soon,” Sergeant Chaves said “Be sure to be ready.”
   4. No one answered. Everyone knew what that meant.
   5. Ramos finished his food slowly.
   6. “I wonder how Maria is doing,” he wondered.
   7. You ask him about Maria.
   8. “Haven’t I talked about her already? I guess not.”
   9. “She’s the one who I’ve been sending all my letters to.”
   10. “The love of my life, waiting for me back home.”
   11. “I don’t always receive letters from her so I’m worried.”
   12. “But I still love her, despite the growing distance between us right now.”
   13. “We were supposed to get married, but now I’m a soldier.”
   14. “I still remember the day I met her. She fell down drunk, dancing at a bar.”
   15. “Laughing and looking so clueless.”
   16. “Can you believe it? So random, but lending a hand led to something so great.”
   17. “We chatted for so long that we hardly realized that it was so late.”
   18. “So I offered her a ride back to her place, can’t let a girl be out and about alone so late at night.”
   19. “And since then, we’ve just been in close contact.”
   20. “Now, we’re approaching marriage. Isn’t it crazy?”
   21. You smiled the whole time and thought to yourself of what a lucky and great guy Ramos is.
   22. “Wow, you really got the stuff,” Diaz said.
   23. “I’m happy for you, I guess. Even if I don’t have a special someone like you.”
5. Gang Pic (Ramos and Diaz):
   1. “It’s okay Diaz, there’s a special someone for everybody.”
   2. “Even for the likes of you!” Ramos said laughingly.
   3. “Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?”
   4. You never thought that you would make friends like them.
   5. You haven’t felt this cheerful in so long.
   6. It’s unbelievable that even during times like these, there are moments like this.
   7. You capture this moment, this brief moment of happiness. 
   8. It fills you with determination to survive.
6. Black Screen:
   1. You think to yourself that maybe one day you too will find a special someone.
   2. “I’ll be sure to invite you guys to our wedding. Don’t even worry about it!”
   3. The next day carried on like usual.
   4. When night fell, the sound of gunfire echoed faintly in the distance. Be it training, or something worse, no one knew.

   4. “You will be leaving two days from now.”
   5. No one spoke. No one rebuked. Everyone understood.
   6. Ramos looked down at the dirt, his jaw tight. Diaz let out a low whistle.
   7. “Two days,” Diaz said. “Guess this place doesn’t seem so bad now.”

   1. Not much training happened in preparation for the upcoming juncture.
4. Camp Area:
   1. The night had become more quiet than usual.
   2. Rumors started to spread about the Legion.

   3. “And so you will be moving by foot until the destination.”
   4. “You must be swift, you must be careful, you must be stealthy.”

   4. He paused, eyes scanning the line.
   5. “Don’t waste what you’ve been given.”
   6. He dismissed you with a nod. 
   7. Not the usual yell, not the usual scowl.

   4. “For luck,” he said.
   5. “You think we’ll need it?” Diaz asked.
   6. “Always.”
   7. The three of you shared it in silence.
   8. The stars above were faint through the smoke, but for a moment, the world felt still.
   9. You sat in silence, with a few hours left. Everyone, writing a letter on a piece of paper.
   10. Ramos wrote to Maria. Diaz instead rolled up his paper and lit it on fire for an improvised cigarette.
   11. “Helps calm the nerves, even if it isn't exactly the same,” he said.
   12. “I wonder if I could escape right about now,” he muttered, “I’m getting so afraid..”
   13. “I understand that. But, if I ditch this place right now, what would Maria think of me?”
   14. You understand what this mission warrants.
   15. Courage, dedication, and determination.
