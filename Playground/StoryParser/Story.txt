Act 1
Week 1
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The convoy comes to a stop before the camp. Other young men spill out, half-dazed from the ride, greeted not by welcome but by shouting.
2. Sgt Chaves:
   1. "Attention! You're soldiers now, not lost sheep. You will address me as Sergeant Chaves or sir, and you'll be following my orders from now on."
   2. Sergeant Chaves' voice cuts through the wind, sharp and unyielding. The air smells of rust and mud. Somewhere in the distance, the sound of gunfire echoes faintly. The war feels closer than you expected.
   3. Sergeant Chaves performs a roll call. One man stammers when called and earns a daunting glare from your superior officer. You keep your eyes forward. Behind you, someone coughs. Another whispers a prayer.
3. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Everyone arrives at the barracks. Along the walls are rows of iron bunks. You smell the musk of damp uniforms and notice the lack of any sanitary equipment.
   2. You drop off your things at your assigned area. You are surrounded by strangers, all wearing the same expression: uncertainty masked as silence.
   3. One of them laughs under his breath. Another mutters that the place looked more like a prison than a camp.
   4. You stay quiet. You don't join in. You just watch the smoke curl toward the ceiling until the whistle blows for lights out.

   1. The next day, dawn brings more shouting. Everyone gathers in the mess hall for breakfast.
5. Meal Time Morning:
   1. "Finish up quickly. We will be proceeding with drills in a few minutes." Sergeant Chaves barks.
   2. As soon as the whistle blows, everyone makes their way to the training grounds.
6. Training:
   1. You train in the mud with the early morning sun beating down on you. What feels like endless drills and constant shouting from Sergeant Chaves brought you and your fellow young men to heel.
   2. Running, crawling, pushups, sit-ups, rifle handling. All with little to no breaks in between.
   3. "You'll learn to fight tired! The enemy won't wait for you to rest!"
   4. You stumbled once, earning a boot to the heel and a growl of "Keep moving!" By the end of it all, your arms shake too much to hold a rifle steady, but you don't dare to drop it.
7. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. The camp winds down to a quiet. Occasional murmurs from nearby bunks, someone passing around leftover food, another hums a tune, low and sad.
8. Black Screen:
   1. This vicious cycle of the campgrounds continues day after day. This is the new reality for everyone here.
9. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. One fateful evening, papers are handed out, and it is announced that everyone is given an opportunity to write to their loved ones. 
   2. You sit in your bunk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. Thinking of home, of your Mom you left behind, of how she will feel knowing the circumstances of your situation.

5. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. That night, the barracks are quieter than usual. The harsh training that day put a toll on everyone.
   2. But you overhear the chatters of someone speaking of their background. A few men trade short words about home. Their distant towns, families, and half-remembered meals.
6. Black Screen:

7. Training:
   1. Rifles crack through the fields. The smell of gunpowder fills the air.
   2. Chaves shouts commands between bursts of noise.
   3. One man's rifle jams, another flinches too early. Everyone wavers, but no one stops.

   5. Sergeant Chaves inspects the field, silent for once, only nodding slightly before ordering everyone to clean their rifles.
8. Black Screen:

   1. You raised your rifle, hands steady. The first shot cracked through the air, sharp and deafening. But the recoil bit your shoulder. 
   2. Next to you, Ramos fired clean and calm. Diaz flinched, cursed under his breath, and tried again.
   3. "You got this Diaz. You'll learn," Ramos said.
   4. "Yeah, if I don't shoot my foot first," Diaz muttered.
   5. The shooting continued for a short while before the Sergeant announced a change of instructions.
   6. "Think of these not as targets anymore, but as enemies. Members of the Legion."
   7. An act so simple, yet you start to falter.
   8. "You hesitate," Chaves growled, "you die."
   9. "These people are monsters. They will do anything to get what they desire."
   10. "Even if it means the lives of others."
   11. But in the mind of these men, they have never taken the life of anyone before.
   12. When the smoke cleared, Chaves walked the line, inspecting each shot.
   13. He stopped in front of you, looked at your target, then nodded, almost approvingly.
   14. You surprised even yourself for that.
3. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Later that day, the men cleaned their rifles in silence. The smell of oil, sweat, and metal filled the air.
   2. Diaz broke it first. "So… when do we stop pretending this is training?"
   3. "When the bullets start firing back." Ramos said.
   4. "Wowie, can't wait," Diaz replied.
   5. You said nothing and stared at your rifle.
4. Meal Time Night:
   1. That evening, the meal was unusually quiet. Chaves stood near the entrance, arms crossed.
   2. The atmosphere felt heavier as the growing fear of conflict continued to haunt the minds of everyone.
   3. "Orders will be here soon," Sergeant Chaves said "Be sure to be ready."
   4. No one answered. Everyone knew what that meant.
   5. Ramos finished his food slowly.
   6. "I wonder how Maria is doing," he wondered.
   7. You ask him about Maria.
   8. "Haven't I talked about her already? I guess not."
   9. "She's the one who I've been sending all my letters to."
   10. "The love of my life, waiting for me back home."
   11. "I don't always receive letters from her so I'm worried."
   12. "But I still love her, despite the growing distance between us right now."
   13. "We were supposed to get married, but now I'm a soldier."
   14. "I still remember the day I met her. She fell down drunk, dancing at a bar."
   15. "Laughing and looking so clueless."
   16. "Can you believe it? So random, but lending a hand led to something so great."
   17. "We chatted for so long that we hardly realized that it was so late."
   18. "So I offered her a ride back to her place, can't let a girl be out and about alone so late at night."
   19. "And since then, we've just been in close contact."
   20. "Now, we're approaching marriage. Isn't it crazy?"
   21. You smiled the whole time and thought to yourself of what a lucky and great guy Ramos is.
   22. "Wow, you really got the stuff," Diaz said.
   23. "I'm happy for you, I guess. Even if I don't have a special someone like you."
5. Ramos n Diaz:
   1. "It's okay Diaz, there's a special someone for everybody."
   2. "Even for the likes of you!" Ramos said laughingly.
   3. "Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
   4. You never thought that you would make friends like them.
   5. You haven't felt this cheerful in so long.
   6. It's unbelievable that even during times like these, there are moments like this.
   7. You capture this moment, this brief moment of happiness. 
   8. It fills you with determination to survive.
6. Black Screen:
   1. You think to yourself that maybe one day you too will find a special someone.
   2. "I'll be sure to invite you guys to our wedding. Don't even worry about it!"
   3. The next day carried on like usual.
   4. When night fell, the sound of gunfire echoed faintly in the distance. Be it training, or something worse, no one knew.

Week 6
Slides (in order):
1. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Days went on, same routines, same meals, same faces.
   2. Until Sergeant Chaves called everyone in earlier than expected.
   3. The expression of the camp shifted.
2. Sgt Chaves:
   1. Sergeant Chaves stood before the regiment, hands clasped behind his back. His voice was steady.
   2. "Orders came in today. The front needs bodies."
   3. "You all are to prepare yourself, pack light and do as you're told."
   4. "You will be leaving two days from now."
   5. No one spoke. No one rebuked. Everyone understood.
   6. Ramos looked down at the dirt, his jaw tight. Diaz let out a low whistle.
   7. "Two days," Diaz said. "Guess this place doesn't seem so bad now."
   8. You nodded silently. The camp that was once felt as miserable had started to feel almost safe.
3. Black Screen:
   1. Not much training happened in preparation for the upcoming juncture.
4. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. The night had become more quiet than usual.
   2. Rumors started to spread about the Legion.
   3. Some said there were spies. Some said they terrorized the innocents.
   4. Everyone began to picture them so evilly, twisted, powerful, the real enemy. Hope starts to waiver.
   5. And so everyone started to fall asleep, a few restless about what is there to come.
5. Black Screen:
   1. The day approaches bit by bit.
   2. The whistle blew a bit later than usual.
   3. One more day left.
6. Mission Briefings:
   1. "You will be making a steady approach."
   2. "You cannot afford to give away your position and yourself very easily."
   3. "And so you will be moving by foot until the destination."
   4. "You must be swift, you must be careful, you must be stealthy."
   5. "It should be around an hour and a half away. You all will advance before dawn, while the sky is still dark out."
   6. "Head eastwards from the camp entrance until you meet similar soldiers in the same uniform."
   7. "Always be on the lookout. Eyes keen, ears sharp."
   8. "Proceed on my command for this assignment. I hope to see at least most of you come back."
   9. "I don't want to train more new recruits than I already do."
   10. Ever so slightly, you understand that Sergeant Chaves cares for everyone as well.
7. Black Screen:
   1. "One last drill. Just a march of endurance."
   2. "Don't worry it won't be long."
8. Sgt Chaves:
   1. Chaves barked orders, but there was no edge to it anymore.
   2. At the end, he stood before the line.
   3. "You've learned what you can here. Out there, you'll learn the rest. Keep your head down. Watch each others' backs."
   4. He paused, eyes scanning the line.
   5. "Don't waste what you've been given."
   6. He dismissed you with a nod. 
   7. Not the usual yell, not the usual scowl.
9. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Everyone gathered their gear, boots laced up, a few trembling hands.
   2. "Best you'll prepare now rather than later," said the Sergeant.
   3. Back at the bunks, Ramos passed around a small token to you and Diaz.
   4. "For luck," he said.
   5. "You think we'll need it?" Diaz asked.
   6. "Always."
   7. The three of you shared it in silence.
   8. The stars above were faint through the smoke, but for a moment, the world felt still.
   9. You sat in silence, with a few hours left. Everyone, writing a letter on a piece of paper.
   10. Ramos wrote to Maria. Diaz instead rolled up his paper and lit it on fire for an improvised cigarette.
   11. "Helps calm the nerves, even if it isn't exactly the same," he said.
   12. "I wonder if I could escape right about now," he muttered, "I'm getting so afraid…"
   13. "I understand that. But, if I ditch this place right now, what would Maria think of me?"
   14. You understand what this mission warrants.
   15. Courage, dedication, and determination.
   16. With everyone writing, you wonder what it's like back at home. You take a moment to reflect.

Week 7
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The whistle blew.
2. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. "Onwards, my soldiers!"
   2. Before dawn broke, the men marched.
3. Black Screen:
   1. The camp shrank in the distance. The mud, the bunks, the drills, all of it swallowed by dust.
4. Marching:
   1. "How much longer do you think this will take?"
   2. "Not too far long from now."
   3. "Do you think there'll be a lot?"
   4. "A lot of bloodshed? A lot of enemies?"
   5. "There's going to be a lot of something that's for sure."
   6. Everyone discussed their own expectations of what has to come.
   7. You just thought of living. To come back to the camp alive alongside Ramos and Diaz.
5. Black Screen:
   1. "Time for the main event," said Ramos.
   2. The regiment has arrived at their destination.
6. MC squad fighting:
   1. The men unloaded their gear by the sandbags, the trenches. It was real now.
   2. As everyone prepares for the fight, tension rises up with Diaz.
   3. "I was never ready! I just want to run away," Diaz said scaringly.
   4. "Don't panic, things will just get worse that way," said Ramos.
   5. "We are here as a group, a regiment, united."
   6. You too felt scared and uncertain. But hearing those words from Ramos ignited a small flame in you.
   7. The first few shots were fired. It was the Legion. They have finally arrived.
   8. The atmosphere gets filled with gunfire, shouting, smoke.
   9. Chaos ensued.
   10. "Fire! Fire! Fire!"
   11. Artillery screamed across the sky. Men shouted, orders blurred into havoc. The ground shook.
   12. You barely had time to think. You just aim, fire, move.
   13. Someone yelled. Someone fell. The smell of blood and dirt filled your lungs.
   14. Ramos was there, shouting to you and Diaz, pulling you down behind cover.
   15. The shooting died down for a moment. Too soon, too quiet.
   16. Someone yelled, "They're regrouping."
   17. You caught a glimpse of the horizon. Black smoke and flashes of light.
   18. Then came the second wave. Louder. Closer.
   19. "Hold the line!" shouted a voice.
   20. A shell hit somewhere near the front. The blast threw you and Diaz to the ground.
   21. When you opened your eyes, everything rang. Ramos was shouting, dragging someone by the arm, someone who didn't move.
   22. You didn't ask who. You just kept firing.
7. Black Screen:
   1. By the time it ended, the sun was already high.
   2. The lieutenant called for retreat. No victory, just survival.
   3. The rescue convoys came, and assisted everyone back to the camp.
   4. The ride back to camp was quiet. No one mentioned the ones who didn't climb aboard.
8. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. When the trucks rolled into camp, it didn't feel like homecoming. The air was thick with smoke and exhaustion.
   2. A few men were injured, some didn't make it back.
9. Sgt Chaves:
   1. The Sergeant had this look on his face. He didn't seem happy or relieved.
   2. He just stared, knowingly, he remembered the faces of those who weren't present.
   3. The bunks were still there, the mud still waiting, but the laughter that once filled the camp was gone.
   4. After a short rollcall, he said softly, "Rest. You all need it."
10. Black Screen:
   1. Before long, came the night. Stars shined less bright that night. The air felt colder than usual.
11. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. The lamps burned low. No one spoke much. A few men cleaned their rifles out of habit. Others just stared at the floor.
   2. You sat on your bunk, the same one as before, but it felt smaller somehow.
   3. "You alright?" asked Ramos.
   4. You don't know how to respond. You just shrugged.
   5. You told him about the ear ringing when the shell hit.
   6. You told him about the ground shaking, the shouting, the endless gunfire.
   7. You told him about how scared you were.
   8. You told him about how you didn't want to die.
   9. "And yet you still remain here," he said.
   10. For a while, neither of you spoke. The silence between you wasn't empty. It was full of what couldn't be said.
   11. Diaz sat on the other side, staring at his boots.
   12. "Can't sleep," he muttered. "Every time I close my eyes, it's like I'm replaying the whole thing."
   13. "Well, let loose with us. Not like we could sleep either," Ramos replied.
   14. You told them both how strange and different the camp felt when you returned. It's almost as if it changed in a way.
   15. "Nothing changed, perhaps we did."
   16. "Don't get poetic on us, Ramos!"
   17. "Just saying we made it. That has to count for something," Ramos chuckled slightly.
   18. A pause. And the laughter faded away.
   19. "I thought I'd never see this place again. Never thought I would miss it so bad," Diaz said.
   20. "Wonder when we will be sent out again."
   21. "Maybe soon? Who knows," Ramos said.
   22. "Maybe next time I won't come back," Diaz said quietly.
   23. "Don't say that Diaz, you will make it back alive. You just have to keep moving"
   24. "That's not what I mean, Ramos."
   25. Another brief moment of silence.
   26. "I heard papers are coming in tonight. What are you going to tell Maria?"
   27. "I don't know Diaz. Might not even tell her to be honest."
   28. "You won't tell her what happened?"
   29. "No. She deserves peace, not this. I'll just tell her I was able to come back."
   30. You told him that Maria deserves your honesty.
   31. "I know. A girl like her deserves more than that, the whole world."
   32. "But some things are just better left unsaid."
   33. To an extent, you find yourself agreeing with him.
   34. You think to yourself that worrying others might do more harm than good.
   35. "What about you? What will you tell your mom?" Diaz asked you.
   36. You shrugged, unsure of what to reply.
   37. You think about what you should write next.

   6. "Without this strength, I won't be able to come home."

1. Black Screen:
   1. It feels like almost two years have passed since the war began.
   2. Time no longer feels like something that moves. More so only something that repeats.
   3. The war hasn't ended, only changed shape.
   4. The regiment still marches forward.
2. Training:
   1. The whistle blows.
   2. You rise with the others, boots scraping against the dirt, rifles clattering into position.
   3. The old crew doesn't complain anymore. The shouting, the drills, they're just part of breathing now.
   4. However, some of the new recruits seem to have a rougher time.
   5. "We got a lot more work to do for some of the newbies."
   6. Some of the old recruits chuckle, while the new recruits stay silent.
3. Sgt Chaves:
   1. "Attention, everyone. Don't forget your role and purpose for this nation."
   2. "Some of the people here have seen it first hand. The true horrors of war."
   3. "They have realized it, and are now working towards a brighter future."
   4. "Now, new soldiers, I want you to do the same."
   5. "I don't want to see you covered in blood and wounds."
   6. "All of you."
   7. "You are better than those monsters, beasts, those heels and sinners."
   8. The Sergeant, still barking as always, but with a firmer tone.
   9. "Yes sir!"
   10. The new recruits still shake. The old ones don't.
   11. "Hey, don't get too worked up about it. You will get there eventually," Ramos whispers.
   12. You look over to Ramos, still kind and optimistic as always.
   13. "But don't get too excited. War is not a kind place," Diaz whispers back.
   14. You look over to Diaz, still the same person as well.
   15. Sergeant Chaves walks the line, his face cut deep with exhaustion.
   16. He still carries his voice like a hammer.
   17. "Form up! Eyes forward! Keep your heads straight, soldiers!"
   18. The echo bounces throughout the camp, swallowed by the wind.
4. Black Screen:
   1. Camp San Aurelio seems to be tougher than it was way back.
   2. The same drills, the same meals, but different faces. Some new, some old, some gone.
5. Meal Time Late Afternoon:
   1. "Doesn't feel the same anymore, huh.."
   2. "Yeah, the Sergeant seems more strict now."
   3. "The drills have gotten tougher as well."
   4. "I wonder when this will be over."
   5. "Same here, brother."
   6. The camp, still full of chatter, still full of uncertainty.
   7. "Still the same slop? Well, as long as they keep feeding us," Diaz mutters.
   8. "If not, I would've just left by now."
   9. You stare at him.
   10. "What? Can you really blame me? Anybody with a right mind would ditch this place."
   11. "We get it Diaz, we can't blame you. I, for one, still fight for my future, my Maria, and my country."
   12. "Maria this, Maria that. I don't have that so.."
   13. "If I could leave, you know I would."
   14. Ramos chuckles. "That's very like you, Diaz. But you cried missing this place in our first battle."
   15. You laugh, but you don't agree or disagree with what Diaz said..
6. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Night falls. Ramos leans against you, letter in hand. He smiles slightly.
   2. "You think she'll still be waiting?" Diaz asks, wiping his rifle clean.
   3. Ramos laughs. "Maria's stubborn. She'll wait even if it takes ten years."
   4. You can't tell if it's hope or denial that keeps his pen moving.
   5. But you still smile faintly, knowing that he looks forward to the future. A future even ten years from now.
   6. But it's got you thinking about your mother again.
   7. The fire burns low, throwing orange light over tired faces.
   8. Ramos hums softly while Diaz is fast asleep.
   9. Chaves stands watch near the perimeter, shoulders squared despite the weight he carries.
   10. You glance at the stars.
   11. They look duller now, smothered by the haze of gunfire and smoke that never quite leaves the sky.

Week 9
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The war has turned into rhythm.
   2. A pattern of sound and silence, breath and gunfire.
   3. You march when told, eat when told, fight when told.
   4. You've become used to these conditions.
   5. And when morning comes again, you rise and so does everyone else.
   6. Another morning. Another set of drills.
2. Sgt Chaves:
   1. "We will be crossing a different route for the march for today."
   2. "As always, I want everyone to be wary of their surroundings."
   3. Sergeant Chaves' voice cuts through the air, sharp as ever. Orders were given.
3. Training:
   1. The sky is pale and thin, the kind that makes the world feel quiet before the noise begins.
   2. "Formation, left flank!"
   3. You fall in line with Ramos and Diaz, rifles raised, boots sinking into the dirt.
   4. Ramos whispers under his breath, "Feels too calm today."
   5. Diaz scoffs. "You'd rather it not be?"
   6. You don't answer. You just keep moving.
   7. "Positions, everyone! Let's get going."
4. Ambush:
   1. The sound of marching echoes its steady and rhythmic beat.
   2. And then, a sudden noise.
   3. Not the whistle. Not the Sergeant's call. A distant rumble, like thunder, but wrong.
   4. Then the world around you explodes.
   5. Dirt erupts, men scatter. The air fills with screams and smoke.
   6. "AMBUSH! TAKE COVER!"
   7. Sergeant Chaves' orders are drowned by the roar of gunfire.
   8. The noise feels endless, bullets tearing through the air, the smell of iron and earth mixing thick in your lungs.
5. Black Screen:
   1. You can't see the others.
   2. You can't even tell where the line is anymore.
   3. You got lost in the chaos.
   4. Someone yells, "Fall back! FALL BACK!"
   5. You run. Branches hit your face, your boots drag through mud.
   6. But you don't know where you need to go.
   7. You run. You don't know how far you've gone.
   8. The smoke hangs low.
   9. You lean against a tree, wounded, rifle jammed, trying to listen past the ringing in your ears. You breathe, even if the air is filled with smoke.
   10. That's when you hear footsteps.
   11. Slow, dragging, uncertain.
6. Leo n MC injured:
   1. A soldier steps out, but he's not one of yours.
   2. His uniform, torn and foreign, marks him as the enemy.
   3. Blood stains his arm, on his stomach. His rifle is gone.
   4. In a worse condition than you are.
   5. Both of you freeze.
   6. Two men. Two sides.
   7. One moment that could end either way.
   8. "Look, I'm not going to hurt you. We are both in no condition to fight anyway."
   9. "I lost my team, it seems like you are the same."
   10. You can't trust him. He's part of the enemy.
   11. But you are exhausted, you don't have the capacity to deal with him.
   12. You both stare at each other in silence, neither raise a hand.
   13. There's no handshake, no trust, just survival.
   14. Just a nod and a silent truce.
   15. Two men. Brought together by instinct.
   16. You gesture towards the direction opposite of the gunfire. 
   17. The both of you traverse westwards. You, guiding the way, the other limping, trailing behind you.
   18. It wasn't long until you met your battalion.
   19. They saw who you were with, and it was an enemy, a member of the Legion.
   20. You explain what happened and the Legion soldier was detained in chains.

   2. "You look like you've been through a lot. What happened?"
   3. You tell him about the adventure you had getting lost and the enemy that stumbled upon you.
   4. "And so I've heard. Did you beat ‘em? Did he try anything on you?"
   5. "Oh, I see. You were both wounded."
   6. "Nice to see you have a kind heart."
   7. "Even if he was an enemy and all that."
   8. You tell him it was out of instinct and pure survival at that point.
   9. You tell him there was no reason to fight.
   10. "I understand, okay."
   11. "Well, anyway. Glad to have you back, brother."
   12. The camp bursts with suspicion. 
   13. Some mutter he should be killed outright.
   14. Others whisper about intel he might yield.
   15. That night, your mind drifts and it starts to relive your encounter.
   16. You still feel tense about the whole situation.

2. Sgt Chaves:
   1. "This soldier, his name is Leo."
   2. "He is not one of our allies. In fact, he is a member of the Legion."
   3. "However, I do not see a need to kill just one member of the Legion."
   4. "After a thorough chat with him, I have decided..."
   5. "Leo would live, guarded, forced to labor under watch."
   6. "The extra manpower will be handy around these parts."
   7. "Do not lower your guard. He is still a member of the fiends of this calamity."
   8. "Understood?"
   9. He steps closer to Leo, lowering his voice.
   10. "Be grateful for your life while you have it."
   11. "Otherwise, you would've died where you stood."
   12. Leo is just standing there, calmly. He doesn't say a word and you both make eye contact.
   13. "You really brought one of them back," Diaz mutters to you.
   14. You nod quietly.
   15. "You know, if he bites back, I'll never forgive you." Followed by a brief moment of silence.
   16. "Alright, back to the drills everyone."
   17. "We are called for yet another operation a few days from now."
   18. "Leo, you will have a special assignment."
3. Few Battles:
   1. Another round of gunshots, another round of smoke.
   2. You feel used to it already.
   3. "A few more rounds then another march!"
   4. The whistle blows and it's finally time to eat.
4. Meal Time Late Afternoon:
   1. "He doesn't seem like a bad guy."
   2. "You don't think anyone is a bad guy, Ramos."
   3. "Haha, Diaz! That's not always true. I just feel it with this one."
   4. "He's got this honest look to him."
   5. You and Diaz don't fully understand Ramos, but in a way, you get what he is trying to say.
   6. "It's still crazy you brought him in here," Diaz mutters. "He is an enemy! He was part of that ambush!" 
   7. "I'm still scared and restless, you know."
   8. "Things haven't gotten better, at least in my eyes."
   9. "Man, I really should've used that opportunity to ditch."
   10. "I feel very uneasy nowadays, and it only gets worse with Leo around."
   11. You all sit in silence.
   12. Ramos speaks up. "Well, he seems to be fully watched so I don't think anything major will happen between us and him."
   13. "Don't worry too much, Diaz. We will be here for you."
   14. "Isn't it better to face it together than alone?"
   15. "I guess not," he replies back. "I'm just scared, that's all. I still really, really want to ditch this place goodbye."
   16. He scoffs. "I wonder what Leo thinks about the slop we get served."
   17. The three of you finish your meals before heading back to the bunks.
   18. You stop halfway and see Leo.
5. Leo Helping:
   1. Leo is moving supplies around the camp.
   2. He is guarded, everyone is looking at him.
   3. Some glare, some whisper.
   4. But he continues to work in silence.
   5. No complaint, no hesitation. A true hard worker.
   6. For a second, you think he looks almost like one of you. Almost.
   7. Leo notices you and nods with a faint smile.
   8. You nod back at him.
   9. "Don't get soft," Diaz says, half-serious.
   10. "Just because he's helping doesn't mean he's forgiven."
   11. You don't reply and continue towards the bunk.
   12. A short rest before you get sent out on another mission.

   4. "But I do want to talk to him."
   5. "He seems interesting. I hope we get to know more about each other!"
   6. "Why am I so positive?"
   7. "He's still a soldier, like us."
   8. "Who knows what he went through."
   9. "And just like us, the homes and lives we've been stripped out of."
   10. "Don't you think there's a chance he could be the same?"
3. Ramos Not Talk:
   1. You don't say anything. You stood in silence.

   6. "No? Good. Otherwise he would've faced death by my hands."
   7. "Right now, he's walking on eggshells at death's door."
   8. "Anything can go wrong for him."
   9. "And he knows that for a fact."
   10. "So he better not go snooping around."
   11. "You all should keep an eye and report to me."
   12. "We still don't know for sure who he is and what he could be up to."

   3. "Maybe he got caught on purpose?"
5. Guy 2 Talk:
   1. "Why would you think someone would throw their life away like that?"

Week 11
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. Days pass by quietly.
   2. The camp is filled with a strange presence. An enemy living alongside his enemies.
2. Sgt Chaves:
   1. Sergeant Chaves' voice cuts across the field.
   2. "Positions! Eyes forward! No excuses for slacking!"
   3. "From now on, Leo will be alongside you soldiers."
   4. "He will be doing basic drills, no rifles yet."
   5. "If he ever dares cross the line with us, he knows what's coming to him."
   6. "He may have proven himself useful outside of combat."
   7. "But the real question is how well he would perform amidst conflict."
   8. "As I have mentioned, he will be joining you all."
   9. He chuckles, "Be it a soldier or as bait!"
   10. Leo still remains quiet, understanding the situation he is in. 
   11. He stands there, in front of everyone while wearing a uniform similar to that of your own.
   12. Diaz whispers, "Haha! I think bait will be a great idea."
3. Training:
   1. The usual drills occur.
   2. Leo is isolated from the rest of the battalion, but still being watched.
   3. "Hey, don't you think he's starting to.. blend in?" Ramos asks you.
   4. You think about it and nod slightly.
   5. "I feel like it would seal the deal if he wore our uniforms."
   6. You look over to Leo and he is doing the drills like no other in your battalion.
   7. Swift, precise, vigorous.
   8. A man strong enough to take down half of your battalion in hand-to-hand combat alone.
   9. Diaz doesn't fully agree. "I don't know about blending in. I still don't trust him."
   10. "Just don't get too friendly," Diaz mutters, but there's no real anger in his tone.
   11. "Focus up, everyone!"
   12. "Yes sir!"
4. Black Screen:
   1. Drills carry on until night.
5. Meal Time Night:
   1. Ramos nudges you. "Think he eats like us now?"
   2. You glance toward Leo. Sitting alone, quietly eating.
   3. Diaz shakes his head. "Doesn't talk, doesn't complain. Just works. I don't get it."
   4. "What does he have for himself?"
   5. "Maybe he just wants to live," Ramos shrugs.
   6. You look at Leo again.
   7. There's a stillness in him.
   8. The kind that doesn't come from peace, but from exhaustion.
   9. And so, you finally got the courage to walk up to him.
   10. "Hey, wait up!" Ramos hurries.
   11. Diaz, looking disappointed, "Seriously?"
   12. As you get close, Leo looks at you. "Hey, if it isn't my guardian?"
   13. "I haven't done proper introductions to anyone, but I'm Leo."
   14. "You three seem close."
   15. "How's camp life been?"
   16. You were about to say something until Ramos cut you off.
   17. "Glad you asked! My name is Ramos, you know this guy, and Diaz."
   18. "We've been through a lot together, that's for sure."
   19. Leo chuckles, "Well I don't doubt it a bit. It's never easy out here, haha!"
   20. You ask him if he is okay.
   21. "It's certainly better than death. You see, I still want to live."
   22. "But thanks for asking, I guess. I'm thankful I've been given an opportunity like this."
   23. "Although the Sergeant does seem a lot more harsh than I would've imagined."
   24. Diaz immediately replies, "That's what I've been saying!"
   25. "All I get from Ramos is that he is doing it for the greater good of us all."
   26. "You know, he isn't completely wrong. To an extent, he cares about you folks," Leo replies. "And I am technically still part of the enemy, so I guess that adds up to the aggressiveness."
6. Black Screen:
   1. "Leo, meal time is up. You will be on patrol with a few of us tonight. Get ready."
   2. "Well, see you guys around."
   3. Leo leaves and the three of you wave goodbye.
   4. Time for lights out.
7. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. "Hey, he doesn't seem like a bad guy.. right guys?" Ramos asks.
   2. "I guess not.. but who knows for sure anyways?"
   3. "It was just one interaction, Ramos."
   4. "Hm, I guess you're right. What do you think?"
   5. You tell them that you see some good light in Leo.
   6. You tell them that you want to chat with him again.
   7. "There will be other opportunities for sure. We just gotta wait for ‘em."
   8. You think of these thoughts for the rest of the night.
   9. You wonder if every Legion soldier is just like Leo.
   10. Or is Leo just part of the very few that are kind.
   11. You always knew the Legion as monsters, evil.
   12. But then Leo appeared in your life.
   13. You think that maybe, just maybe, Leo isn't a monster at all.
   14. You think this person is genuinely kind and is doing his best to survive.
   15. That he was never a monster to begin with.
   16. You think that this may be the case for other Legion soldiers.
   17. That they can be the same as you, forced to serve, struggling for survival.
   18. Just like Leo.

   6. "Different kind of man."

Week 12
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. What feels like weeks have passed.
   2. The presence of Leo doesn't alarm everyone as much as it did back then.
   3. Leo has been helping around the camp ever since he was captured.
   4. Diaz still has his doubts about him, but is slowly starting to accept him.
   5. Today, new orders have arrived.
2. Mission Briefings:
   1. "Listen up. Command has assigned us to secure a nearby supply route. Minimal resistance is to be expected."
   2. His eyes sweep across the line and they linger a moment on Leo.
   3. He continues, "Leo will come along. I'll see if his presence can be… useful."
   4. "Thus, I will tag along in this operation."
   5. A few soldiers exchange uneasy looks.
   6. Diaz whispers, "He's bringing the Legion dog with us now? Really?"
   7. Ramos replies softly, "C'mon, he's earned the chance. Don't you two think so?"
   8. "I mean, sure I guess. He still needs to be watched though."
   9. You don't say anything, but you feel the weight of the moment.
3. Marching:
   1. The dirt path winds through the woods, quiet except for the shuffle of boots.
   2. Leo walks behind Ramos, carrying a crate of ammo.
   3. You keep an eye on him, out of instinct more than mistrust.
   4. Ramos hums faintly. "It's calm today."
   5. Diaz mutters, "Not the first time you've said that."
   6. Chaves raises a hand. "Stop."
   7. The squad halts.
   8. You hear the faint rustling of leaves and metallic clatter. Footsteps are almost nearly silent but swift.
   9. Leo recognizes the pattern of a similar encounter as part of his training with the Legion.
   10. "This is how they begin their ambush Sergeant."
   11. "The Legion should have around 10 troops ready for combat."
   12. "They will be approaching from both sides, left and right, a 5 man split."
   13. Sergeant Chaves looks at Leo. "You've done this before, haven't you?"
   14. "How many lives did you take?"
   15. The atmosphere became slightly filled with animosity.
   16. Leo doesn't reply, and insists on trusting him so they can avoid conflict.
   17. Everyone is left with no choice but to do what Leo says to do.
   18. A tense silence follows as everyone holds their breath.
   19. Diaz, ready to leave at this very moment, but his legs start to shake.
   20. Leo signals everyone with a gun to get up and shoot.
   21. "In three, two, one."
   22. "FIRE!"
   23. Gunshots, followed by a short relief.
   24. Diaz stands up, confused. "We did it?"
   25. "My intel confirms that these were the only casualties."
   26. "We are free to head back."
   27. Ramos claps Leo on the shoulder. "You saved us out there."
   28. Leo shakes his head. "Just did what anyone would."
   29. You were amazed by the stunt he pulled and by the fact everyone followed his orders.
   30. You compliment his tactics.
   31. "It's nothing really. We learned this all the way back in Obersreich."
   32. Chaves watches from a distance. His voice is unreadable when he finally speaks.
   33. "Maybe he's not useless after all."
   34. Diaz scoffs, but not as sharply as before.
   35. "He's still Legion," he mutters. "A very useful and smart one at that."
4. Black Screen:
   1. The camp is noisier than ever.
   2. Talks about Leo are spreading from soldier to soldier.
   3. Leo is roaming around the camp more frequently.
5. Meal Time Night:
   1. That night, Leo decides to eat with you and the others.
   2. "Mind if I eat here?" Leo asked politely.
   3. "Go for it," Ramos replied.
   4. "Feels nice to have some company again."
   5. "I hope you folks don't feel so startled by me anymore."
   6. "Especially you.. Diaz was it?"
   7. He nods silently in disappointment.
   8. "Don't sweat it."
   9. Ramos laughs at Diaz. "Great catch."
   10. "By the way, why don't you tell us who you are?"
   11. "What are you fighting for?"
   12. "We are all soldiers aren't we?"
   13. "We all fight for something."
   14. You are curious as well and ask the same things as Ramos.
6. Leo Story Tell:
   1. And shortly after, a small crowd forms around Leo as he begins to chatter.
   2. "Well, you see.. I would love to see my family again."
   3. "Family?"
   4. "Yes, my wife and two kids. The joys of my life."
   5. "However, my wife has been chronically ill since her mid teens."
   6. "And things definitely took a turn before I left."
   7. "My poor boys are looking after her now."
   8. "So young, yet they love their mother as much as I do."
   9. "So young, but they have to carry such a heavy burden."
   10. "Normally, I would be the one to take care of them all."
   11. "Like a breadwinner?"
   12. "Yes, precisely."
   13. "My wife's illness is still to be determined."
   14. "We don't know yet for sure what it is."
   15. "But I hope she and the kids are doing alright."
   16. "My kids, they don't share the same illness as her mother."
   17. "They seem to be quite healthy in comparison. Perhaps it was from me, haha."
   18. "This might be a dumb question to ask, but do you miss home?"
   19. "Of course. I miss every second of it. I miss my homeland in Obersreich."
   20. "The food there was definitely better than what I've been fed here, haha!"
   21. "But then again, supplies are rough so I understand that this is the quality of the meals we share."
   22. "Anyway, Obersreich is where I grew up. In a small city away from the metropolis."
   23. "Although my life wasn't exactly perfect. The previous war had left my family in a rough spot."
   24. "There are no winners in war."
   25. "That's just how it is."
   26. "Obersreich, huh.. Why were you brought here anyway from so far away?"
   27. "Well, as part of a special soldier program, I was assigned for an operation overseas which would pay a huge sum of money."
   28. "A joint conquest with the Helion Empire."
   29. "And I guess that operation led me here."
   30. "Special soldier? You must be quite skilled then."
   31. "Indeed I was, not to brag."
   32. "I'm sort of ashamed that I ended up lost and wounded that day."
   33. "As someone of my caliber, I shouldn't have made such a rookie mistake."
   34. "But we aren't all perfect."
   35. "Do you regret that?"
   36. "It's hard to say."
   37. "I would've taken any path that had me alive in it, haha!"
   38. "It seems like I've shared quite a bit of myself. What about you three?"
   39. You tell him about how you and your mother lived in a small town as well.
   40. You tell him about your conscription, how you had to leave her at home so abruptly.
   41. You tell him about the letters the people send.
   42. "Letters huh? Very interesting, wish I had that sort of communication at the very least."
   43. "My family is so far away, haha!"
   44. "So you send letters to your mother, what a sweet child."
   45. "It's unfortunate that you two had to separate."
   46. "What about the two of you? Ramos, Diaz?"
   47. "I send them to my dear Maria! The love of my life and soon to be wife! Well, hopefully at least."
   48. "Oh Maria, I miss you very much. I am waiting for your next letter!"
   49. Leo smiles. "Seems like you have a lot going on with her. I'm happy for you both. I wish you and her nothing but happiness and prosperity."
   50. "I wonder what my wife is thinking about right now. Perhaps the same as your Maria, haha!"
   51. "I wish I could exchange letters with my wife and kids. It would mean the world to me to hear from them again after so long."
   52. "And I'm sure it would mean the world to them if you came back home," Ramos replies.
   53. Leo nods.
   54. "What about you, Diaz?"
   55. "Me? I don't really have anyone to write to."
   56. "To me, there's no point in doing any of that."
   57. "It won't make anything in this war better."
   58. "Food won't get better, battles won't end sooner."
   59. "I have nothing to look after but myself."
   60. "So I just use the papers for.. whatever."
   61. "I just want to leave."
   62. "I just want to escape."
   63. "It sounds selfish, I get it."
   64. "But is it really my fault?"
   65. "Can you blame me for thinking so? I didn't choose to be here."
   66. "Do I really need to bear any responsibility?"
   67. "It's not even my fault."
   68. "I just want to be somewhere safe and peaceful."
   69. "I'm scared. Scared of death. Scared of uncertainty."
   70. Leo looks at Diaz. "Listen, here."
   71. "You can't be blamed for any of that, Diaz."
   72. "It's only natural for us humans to want to live."
   73. "Unfortunately, there are just no good sides to war."
   74. "Even if you leave now, you may eventually be caught and face even worse consequences."
   75. "But, I understand what you mean."
   76. "Running away and being somewhere safe. It sounds ideal."
   77. "For me, I find safety in the arms of my family."
   78. "I, too, wish I could run away from this war."
   79. "I want to run back into their lives."
   80. "But even if I do, there's still no peace."
   81. "War leaves no breaks for anyone."
   82. Ramos asks, "Leo, be honest with me. Why do you intend on helping us?"
   83. "I'm a bit selfish myself so.. I do it purely to survive."
   84. "So I continue to fight, to live, until it fully ends."
   85. "Until I can fully return home to them."
   86. "But I wonder what they will think of me."
   87. "Someone who joined forces with the enemy."
   88. "Or perhaps they will just be glad to see me alive."
   89. "If this is the path that lets me live another day, I will gladly stay on this path."
   90. "No good will come from harm in my eyes."
   91. "My real intentions are to go back home. Be it the easiest way possible."
   92. "And so far, I have a feeling that helping you guys will be an easy ticket out."
   93. "But who am I to decide that, haha!"
7. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. The conversation kept going.
   2. Leo kept talking about his wife, his kids, and his home.
   3. But then orders were made to cut the noise.
   4. Back at your bunk, you think to yourself about Leo.
   5. Leo is definitely not a monster.
   6. The Legion is depicted as cruel, but Leo tells another story.
   7. Leo, a member of the Legion, is a very caring and honest person.
   8. Although, not every soldier is like Leo. But that doesn't mean that no one else is.
   9. For the first time, you wonder. 
   10. If the enemy laughs, works, and bleeds like you do… then what separates you from them?
   11. The lines between what is an enemy and what isn't began to blur.
8. Black Screen:
   1. Your mind gets hazy with all these thoughts.
   2. But you are firm with your belief in Leo. That he is inherently a good person.

5. Leo Speaking:
   1. "..."
   2. "That's very touching to hear."
   3. "I can't blame you for thinking that way. It's only natural."
   4. "To be honest, I was scared of you guys as well."
   5. "Though, I never really viewed anyone as a ‘monster' or anything like that."
   6. "But, I understand."

   4. "What do I think of Leo?"
   5. "Well, seems like a great guy."
   6. "He's helped us around so much it's kind of crazy to think he's part of the enemy."
   7. "He also helped me a couple times.."
   8. "Won't forget the shower incident.."
   9. "But overall seems like a great guy."
   10. "..."

3. Sergeant Talk:
   1. "Soldier.."
   2. "The one who brought Leo here."
   3. "You sure did cause a ruckus amongst us all."
   4. "But.."
   5. "I'm a tad bit glad."
   6. "I was very doubtful at first.."
   7. "Well, I still have some doubts."
   8. "But Leo here has been a great help. I cannot argue with that."
   9. "But soldier.. I'm afraid if this ever happens again, we cannot let the next enemy stay alive."
   10. "This is an order coming from me."
   11. "I do not wish to worry our fellow comrades."
   12. "So if you happen to come across somebody again, you must do what you were trained to do."
   13. "Otherwise, you would be left in the dust."
   14. "Got that?"
4. Sergeant Not Talk:
   1. No words just salute back.
   2. And he just walks away.

Week 13
Slides (in order):
1. Black Screen:
   1. The days pass quietly. Days turn to weeks.
   2. The fighting slows.
   3. The camp starts to breathe again even if only for a while.
2. Training:
   1. The whistle blows and training begins early in the morning.
   2. But it doesn't last for long.
   3. You, Ramos, and Diaz fall in line.
   4. Leo is there too, carrying supplies across the field.
   5. His movements are steady. Practiced like someone who's done this his whole life.
   6. Diaz mutters, "Look at him. He doesn't even flinch when they bark at him."
   7. Ramos replies, "He's just doing what he can. Maybe he's used to being yelled at."
   8. You stay quiet.
3. Meal Time Morning:
   1. The four of you sit together. A habit that grew, a habit that no one talks about.
   2. Diaz stirs his soup. "Can't believe we're still eating this sludge."
   3. Ramos shrugs. "Could be worse. Could be no sludge at all."
   4. Leo nods. "Yeah, at least there is sludge."
   5. You ask Leo if he knows anything about cooking.
   6. "Of course, but nothing beats the meals my wife makes."
   7. "I can only do some of the basics."
   8. "And I was taught how to survive in the wilderness so I could probably whip up a small, but nice meal if I come across the ingredients."
   9. "You know… you're really not what I expected," Diaz says suddenly.
   10. Leo looks up. "And what did you expect?"
   11. "Someone I could hate easier," Diaz replies.
   12. You don't say anything, but somewhat, you agree.
   13. You never imagined a likeable Legion soldier.
   14. But you are glad you met someone like Leo.
   15. Leo doesn't smile this time. "I'm not asking for your kindness. Just your honesty. I could say the same about you folks."
   16. Diaz exhales, turns away. "Yeah. Guess that's fair. Sorry about that."
   17. "Not like I could've done anything about your prejudice against the Legion."
   18. "But I guess I'm glad you don't hate me anymore."
4. Black Screen:
   1. Nights fall quieter now.
   2. The campfire doesn't crackle with much laughter, only quiet talk.
   3. Stories get traded not as soldiers, but as people remembering they once had lives beyond this place.
   4. Even Leo.
   5. In the stillness, you realize how thin the line has become.
   6. Between enemy and ally, between stranger and brother.
5. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Another restless evening.
   2. Ramos says quietly, "You're still up?"
   3. "What got you thinking up late?"
   4. You ask Ramos what it means to be an enemy.
   5. "Well, I can't really tell you. It doesn't seem like I am your enemy," he chuckles quietly.
   6. You tell him about Leo.
   7. What you've been thinking about and despite what was taught to you, you don't view him as a monster.
   8. "Glad we're on the same page."
   9. "I don't view him as a monster either, or someone not human."
   10. "He is just like us all. We can see that."
   11. You ask him a question.
   12. "Why are we fighting? I don't know."
   13. "Not everyone is like Leo. From what I know, the people with power are hungry for.. well, more power."
   14. "That's just the reality."
   15. You ask him what Maria would think.
   16. "Maria will most likely say the same thing."
   17. "She sees the good in everyone like I do."
   18. "What would your mother say?"
   19. You sit quietly and reflect. You shrug, unsure of what to say.

   1. "Uh.."
   2. Leo seems to be caught in the middle of a quarrel.
12. Leo Not Talk:
   1. "And why would I do that Carlo?"
   2. "Oh, you want to know why?"
   3. "Because you were literally complaining a few seconds ago."
   4. "And all of a sudden, you have a giant pile of slop on your plate."
   5. "And lo and behold, my portions seem to have SHRUNK."
   6. "..."
   7. Seems like Jose has nothing to say.
13. Leo Talk:
   1. "Listen, I can share some of my food with you Carlo."
   2. "What if you just let it go?"
   3. "It's not something worth expending your energy for."
14. Leo Not Talk:
   1. "..."
   2. "I guess."
   3. Carlo takes from Leo.
   4. "Thank you."
   5. "But that doesn't change the fact that Jose is a RAT."
   6. Leo doesn't say anything and has this awkward smile on his face.
15. Leo Talk:
   1. "Well, that's all sorted out. See you folks around."
16. Leo Not Talk:
   1. Leo walks towards your direction.

   7. "And those that are against you."
   8. "Leo?"
   9. "Well.. he's a special case."
   10. "..People can change.. I guess.."
   11. "I don't know!"
   12. "That's all I can say."
4. Diaz Not Talk:
   1. You don't force him to talk.
   2. You just let him be.

   3. "The higher-ups set up a prisoner exchange with the Legion. We give them their man back. They give us ours."
   4. "It was a tough decision for me to make, but our people are more important than theirs."
   5. He glances toward Leo.
   6. "Prepare him. The convoy leaves in two hours."
   7. Ramos looks like he's been punched in the chest.
   8. Diaz mutters, "Figures. The one time we get a decent worker around here…"
   9. You don't say anything.

   11. "I know some of you enjoyed his presence."
   12. Sergeant Chaves glances at you, Ramos, and Diaz.
   13. "But it had to be done."
   14. You tell yourself it's just another order.
   15. But it doesn't feel that way.
3. Overcrowded Camp:
   1. Leo gathers what little he owns at his bunk.
   2. Ramos sits on the floor. "Guess that's it, huh?"
   3. Leo gives a faint smile. "Seems so."
   4. Diaz scoffs, arms crossed. "Don't look so calm. If I were you, I'd already be running away."
   5. Leo meets his eyes. "If I wanted to run, I would've done it long ago."
   6. Silence follows.
   7. Even Diaz can't come up with an answer.
   8. You hand Leo a small canteen of water.
   9. He takes it. "Thanks. For everything."
   10. Ramos lets out a shaky breath. "You think they'll treat you alright out there?"
   11. "I don't expect kindness. Just a chance to make it back home."
   12. "You'll get there. Maria always says.." he stops himself, realizing the name means nothing to Leo, "..she says the good ones always find their way back."
   13. Leo chuckles softly. "Then I'll hold on to that."
   14. He turns to you. "You could've let me die that day. You didn't."
   15. You don't answer right away, but you told him it didn't feel right.
   16. "War makes right and wrong hard to tell apart. But I'll remember this. All of you."
   17. Diaz shifts uncomfortably, muttering under his breath. "Just don't make us regret it."

   2. Diaz says nothing, though his eyes follow every step.
   3. You watch Leo leave every step of the way.
   4. He glances back once, lets out a faint smile.
   5. It's almost as if he is trying to say goodbye.
   6. It's almost as if he makes a promise to go back home.
   7. You wonder why he had to go.
   8. Ramos says, "The lives of these soldiers bear the same weight as Leo's."
   9. "If we were to not exchange, those men would've died."
   10. "And perhaps in spite of that, Leo would be killed as well."
   11. "It is unreasonable to let any of them die."
   12. "They deserve a chance to live."
   13. You nod, but a part of you feels empty.

   1. The engine starts.
